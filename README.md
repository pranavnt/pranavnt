## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pranav Teegavarapu, and I'm a Junior at Tesla STEM High School! I'm really interested in Machine Learning and Full Stack Development and have completed multiple projects in those fields! 

<ul>
  <li>I'm currently working on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kobra-dev">Kobra</a>, a visual programming language for ML. Check it out at <a target="_blank" href="https://kobra.dev">kobra.dev</a></li>
  <li>Last summer, I worked as a TA as part of <a target="_blank" href="https://labs.codeday.org">Codeday Labs</a> and helped interns with programming issues they ran into.</li>
  <li>I'm also part of <a target="_blank" href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, an international community of teen hackers, and absolutely love it! If you're a teen hacker, you should join the Slack :)</li>
</ul>
