## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pranav Teegavarapu, and I'm a sophomore at Tesla STEM High School! I'm really interested in Machine Learning and Full Stack Development and have completed multiple projects in those fields! 
<ul>
  <li>I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/kobra-dev">Kobra</a>, a visual programming language for ML. Stay tuned for updates :)</li>
  <li>Over the summer, I interned at BrainSquall (a local startup) and worked in frontend web dev (in React) and Data Analytics (in Python)</li>
  <li>I also am a contributer to Libra, an open-source machine learning API that automated the ML pipeline (all to way from preprocessing to hyperparameter optimization) to a one-line function call. I am working on building a Q&A query</li>
</ul>
