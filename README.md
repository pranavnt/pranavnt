## Hello World 👋

I'm Pranav Teegavarapu, and I'm a Junior at Tesla STEM High School! I'm really interested in Machine Learning and Full Stack Development and have completed multiple projects in those fields! 

<ul>
  <li>I'm currently working on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kobra-dev">Kobra</a>, a visual programming language for ML. Stay tuned for updates :)</li>
  <li>Over the summer, I interned at <a target="_blank" href="https://brainsquall.co">BrainSquall</a> and wrote performant web frontends in React and Data Analytics  pipelines in Python.</li>
  <li>I'm also a contributor to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Palashio/Libra">Libra</a>, an open-source machine learning API that automates and abstracts away ML pipelines in their entirety—all the way from preprocessing to hyperparameter optimization. I am working on building a Q&A query</li>
</ul>
