## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pranav Teegavarapu, and I'm a rising sophomore at Tesla STEM High School! My interests lie primarily with Machine Learning and Web Development, and I've completed multiple projects in these fields. 

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
I'm currently an intern at BrainSquall, a SaaS startup that's simplying the process of business research by synchronizing a mindmap, outline, and table all into one. I began by working on frontend web development in Reactjs and am now working on Data Analytics.

In addition, I'm a contributor to Libra, an open-source machine learning API that fully automates the standard ML pipeline (all to way from preprocessing to hyperparameter optimization) to a one-line function call. I am currently workiing on the NLP module and am building a Question Answering query.

Finally, I love hackathons, and have been using them as a means to applying many of the skills I've learned and would love it if you could check out some of my projects! My favorite projects include Simplitize, MyMask, and PhishingNet. Feel free to reach out if you want to work together on a hackathon project :D

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Socket.io
- MongoDB
- Decentralized Applications
- Transformers
- Deep Q Learning (and Reinforcement Learning in general)

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on 
I'd love to work on a hackathon project with you, and shoot me an email if you'd like to work together :D. I also am working on a few personal projects, and it would be great if you could reach out if you're interested in working with Socket.io or Tensorflow.js 

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
I'd love to chat about recent developments in NLP (GPT-3, multimodal NLP, etc.) NLP is a field that I've recently gotten interested in, and am trying to learn as much as I can about the field. If you have experience in NLP, and would like to chat, feel free to shoot me an email and I'd love to talk with you :)
