## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pranav Teegavarapu, and I'm a rising sophomore at Tesla STEM High School! My interests lie primarily with Machine Learning and Web Development, and I've completed multiple projects in these fields. 

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
I'm currently and intern at BrainSquall, a SaaS startup that's simplying the process of  by synchronizing a mindmap, outline, and table all into one. I began by working on frontend web development in Reactjs and am now working on Data Analytics.

In addition, I'm a contributor to Libra, an open-source machine learning API that fully automates the standard ML pipeline (all to way from automatic preprocessing to hyperparameter optimization) to a one-line function call. I am currently workiing on the NLP module and am building a Question Answering query.

Finally, I love hackathons, and have been using them as a means to applying many of the skills I've learned and would love it if you could check out some of my projects! My favorite projects include Simplitize, MyMask, and PhishingNet. Feel free to reach out if you want to work together on a hackathon project :D
